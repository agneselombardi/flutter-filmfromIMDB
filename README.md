Call Api to create an app that display IMDB films
In this file I created an application that display the first page of movies of the IMDB API.
The theme app folder contains the theme settings of my application.
In movie_class I created a class that maps my variables to those in the json (i only display in the app vote average, poster and title).
In movie_json there is the call to the API.
Array_class create a mapping to the json with page and results. Results contain the list of movies.
In the main I define the app.
